Skinner: Bamphalas
Skin Name: GreyFox
Model Used: Punisher by Brian "EvilBastard" Collins
Date 7-29-99

This is the eighth of my weekly skins available at my site.  http:\\i.am\bamphalas\
Special thanks to Brian "EvilBastard" Collins for the creation of the very cool punisher model.  Finally, a male model without any of the extra bulk from clothing accessories (backpack, shoulder pads, etc.)  I had to jump on the creation of the Ninja from the Metal Gear Solid game.  I hope you guys like him!  Let me know what you think at my skins forum!
